# gists

This repository is a collection of Flutter and Dart recipes in GitHub Gists that can be also immediately executed and tested in DartPad. I find that it's a great way to learn, understand and discover Flutter's features. For all gists, I give a short introduction with links to relevant articles or the documentation.

## Call to action 🚀

If you find this repo helpful, I'd appreciate your help with getting the word out!

## Ideas

* SnackBar with all the customizations
* Show SnackBars with Scaffold vs Scaffold Manager - The Differences
* App Bar 3-dots icons for popup menu
* Old school "Toast" message using the snack bar
* Show snack bar after the material page popped off with a return value
* text widget that expand in column (so that it's aligned correctly)
* ltr-rtl differences
